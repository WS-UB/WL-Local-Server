# MinIO Database

## Introduction:
This repository contains Python scripts and configurations to interact with MinIO, store data efficiently in Parquet format, and query stored data via Elasticsearch. The system also features an MQTT subscriber for real-time data ingestion. It is built to handle incoming sensor data streams and store them in MinIO for further analysis.
